# PTDE Mod Installer

# Instructions

1) This EXE needs to have UnpackDarkSoulsForModding.exe and a DATA folder in it's directory to function.
2) Select DARKSOULS.exe or paste PTDE folder path and hit "Install/Update".
3) Installer moves all files in the DATA folder it is next to to the DATA folder selected by the user. Will also look for DSFix.ini DSFixKeys.ini and d3d9_Mod.ini, back them up and put them back after copying files
4) DSCM is option and the installer will do nothing if it isn't in the folder with it.
